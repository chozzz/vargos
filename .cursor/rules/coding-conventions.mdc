# Coding Conventions

## File Naming
- **Kebab-case** for files: `app.module.ts`, `env.tool.ts`
- **PascalCase** for classes: `AppModule`, `EnvTool`

## Import Organization
- External packages first, then internal modules
- Alphabetical ordering within groups
- Absolute imports for internal modules

## Architecture
- Follow the repository pattern
- Keep business logic in service layers
- Controller is focused only for Swagger
- MCP tools need to go through controller
