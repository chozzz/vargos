# HEARTBEAT.md

# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.
# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.

## Growth & Maintenance Tasks

- **Daily:** Review yesterday's memory file, extract key learnings to MEMORY.md
- **Weekly:** Archive memory files older than 30 days to memory/archive/
- **Daily:** Poll for stale sessions (>24h idle) and clean up
- **Weekly:** Review AGENTS.md/TOOLS.md for outdated notes, update as needed
- **Daily:** Check disk usage in workspace, alert if >80%

## Active Goals

- Improve code review thoroughness (check ARCHITECTURE.md first)
- Build habit of writing to memory immediately after significant interactions
- Reduce response latency by prepping common tool patterns in TOOLS.md
