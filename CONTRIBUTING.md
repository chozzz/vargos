## 🛤️ Our Contribution Philosophy

While we prefer issues, ideas, and feedback, we do accept code contributions - just with a few extra steps to keep things tidy.

## ✅ We Love Issues!

- **Questions** ❓  

If you spot a bug, have a cool idea, or just want to chat about the project, please [open an issue](https://github.com/chozzz/vargos/issues)!

## 🛑 Before You Submit a PR

1. **Open an Issue or Discussion First:**  
   Please propose your idea or bugfix in an issue before opening a pull request. This helps us keep the project focused and avoid duplicate work.
2. **Wait for Feedback:**  
   We'll discuss your idea and let you know if a PR would be welcome.
3. **Follow the Style Guide:**  
   Keep your code clean, documented, and tested.

## 🚦 PRs May Not Always Be Merged

We review all contributions carefully, but we may not merge every PR. Please don't take it personally—we're just keeping the project on track!
